<text> I fell in love with her when I saw her eyes . She posted this song one day , tears were in my eyes. I met her once and felt so scared of myself and what I was feeling cause I knew ourlives couldn't meet in the end. Two people seeking for love but with so different lives. God I can't stop crying.﻿ <!text>
